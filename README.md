# ClosestPointProblem

This project implements an efficient algorithm to solve the closest pair of points problem using a combination of divide-and-conquer and merge sort techniques. The algorithm computes the shortest distance between any two points from a set of 2D points, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). It includes a brute-force approach for small datasets and uses custom comparators to sort points based on their coordinates. The solution reads point data from .txt files and outputs the closest pair of points and their distance.

Feel free to modify based on specific details or add instructions on how to run the code!
